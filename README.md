‚ÄúADVOCATING FOR FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION‚Äù
Our website is dedicated to empowering Asian youths to dress freely and with confidence. We believe that everyone deserves the freedom and opportunity to express themselves through fashion, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation. This commitment reflects through our name: ‚ÄúLavender‚Äù is the color symbolic of LGBTQ+ resistance and empowerment, and ‚Äútulle" represents that fashion is the main source of inspiration for our project.

The problem that our site is trying to solve:
We‚Äôre trying to show in our website how the worlds of fashion and queer culture have been intertwined.
Clothes are a great way for individuals to shape and articulate their identify. 
The ever-changing characteristic of fashion made it easy to adapt to the LGBT+ trends to create definitive statements and styles.
Moreover, the queer community and its culture have heavily influenced fashion.
We are trying to show the representation of Asians in LGBTQ+ fashion!
